## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interestested in using Airbnb data from 2020 and 2021 to better understand:

1. What was the impact of the pandemic on Airbnb accommodation from the second outbreak onwards?
2. How did hosts react to the ever-changing circumstances?
3. Which are the key success factors to attract guests in this situation?

The full set of files related to this are available in [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html) and [Spanish Health Ministry](https://cnecovid.isciii.es/covid19/#documentaci%C3%B3n-y-datos)


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

There are 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the above questions.  This notebook is exploratory in searching through the data pertaining to the questions showcased by the notebook title.  Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.  

## Results<a name="results"></a>

The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://jorgemedial.medium.com/how-to-keep-afloat-your-airbnb-during-traveling-restrictions-2b736560b305).
